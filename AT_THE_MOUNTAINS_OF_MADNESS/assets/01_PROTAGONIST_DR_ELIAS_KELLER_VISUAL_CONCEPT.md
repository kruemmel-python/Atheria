# Visual Concept - Dr. Elias Keller

Intent: Present Keller as a control-driven scientist whose grief slowly breaks visual certainty.

## Non-negotiables
- Keller never plays as an action hero silhouette.
- Inner conflict must be readable in micro-behavior before dialogue states it.
- His final ambiguity (accepted vs replaced) must remain unresolved visually.

## Do / Don't
### Do
- Keep him centered in analytical frames early, then destabilize composition gradually.
- Repeat notebook and photo motifs as cognitive anchors.
- Use short stillness before key answers to signal internal lag.
### Don't
- Do not over-emote in close-ups; keep stress mostly subcutaneous.
- Do not style him as visibly "infected horror makeup" too early.
- Do not resolve his identity status with explicit prosthetic transformation.

## Key Frames
- KF-01: Helicopter interior, photo of son, muted side light.
- KF-02: Notebook insert ("verstehe" crossed into "beweise").
- KF-03: Subtle blood trace after registration moment.
- KF-04: Chamber close-up on son-like iteration, denial beat.
- KF-05: Isolation mirror and pupil event.

## Practical vs VFX Split
- Practical: Wardrobe wear, blood trace, eye-line choreography, notebook/photo props.
- VFX: Minimal pupil geometry alteration, subtle eye specular shift.
- Guardrail: All VFX on Keller should read as "almost deniable."

## Lighting Notes
- Act I: neutral cool key, clean facial planes.
- Act II: harder side ratio, deeper orbit shadows under eye.
- Act III: flat institutional white with isolated high-contrast eye moments.

## Makeup/FX Escalation
- Level 1 (`#13`): near-invisible nose blood cue.
- Level 2 (`#24` to `#28`): skin dryness, under-eye depth, micro-fatigue.
- Level 3 (`#28`, `#34`): brief pupil non-human geometry, immediate return to normal.

## Wardrobe Contamination Rule
- Act I: clean technical layers with minor frost edge.
- Act II: humidity and particulate marks increase; gloves and sleeve seams darken.
- Act III: controlled contamination remains, but no overt creature goo aesthetic.
