# Environment Visual Concept - Iteration Chamber and Archive Wall

Intent: Deliver the film's central ontological shock through controlled visual escalation, not spectacle overload.

## Non-negotiables
- Chamber reveal must be staged in steps, never as one total dump.
- Bodies read as archived series, not gore tableau.
- Archive wall contact is the perception rupture pivot.

## Do / Don't
### Do
- Preserve massive depth and serial geometry before character detail.
- Use actor reaction timing as reveal metronome.
- Keep entity presence measured and procedural.
### Don't
- Do not front-load every creature or variation detail at first entry.
- Do not cut chamber geography into incoherent fragments.
- Do not let FX layers obscure row structure.

## Key Frames
- KF-01: rows in darkness before identity recognition.
- KF-02: first clear human silhouette in preserved state.
- KF-03: near-human variation contrast frame.
- KF-04: archive wall activation at hand contact.
- KF-05: chamber-wide realization composition after "versionen" reveal.

## Practical vs VFX Split
- Practical: chamber floor rows in near/mid field, key preserved forms, wall contact surface.
- VFX: deep row extension, relief animation, atmospheric depth and scale continuity.
- Guardrail: practical chamber logic must remain dominant in hero coverage.

## Lighting Notes
- Low ambient baseline with hard practical beam sculpting.
- Keep eye adaptation effect through dark-to-detail reveal progression.
- Restrict warm tones to rare human markers only.

## Reveal Ladder (4-step logic)
- Step 1: Reihen-Geometrie (pattern before meaning).
- Step 2: Menschliche Form (recognition without context).
- Step 3: Variation / near-human drift (identity destabilization).
- Step 4: Archivwand-Kontakt (perception rupture and thesis confirmation).
