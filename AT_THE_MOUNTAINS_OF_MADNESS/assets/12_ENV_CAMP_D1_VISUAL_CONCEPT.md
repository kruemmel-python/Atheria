# Environment Visual Concept - Camp D1

Intent: Present Camp D1 as "wrong normal" architecture where procedural order replaces human panic.

## Non-negotiables
- Camp should feel active-adjacent, not abandoned-ruin.
- Every room must imply previous methodical action.
- Corridor contact scene must read as measurement, not attack.

## Do / Don't
### Do
- Preserve clean technical geometry and practical functionality.
- Build tension through micro-anomalies in otherwise orderly spaces.
- Keep navigation readable so dread comes from meaning, not confusion.
### Don't
- Do not dress the camp as random disaster aftermath.
- Do not push gore coding over forensic precision.
- Do not collapse scene geography with chaotic camera movement.

## Key Frames
- KF-01: first entry into ordered but empty main module.
- KF-02: wall protocol drawings under controlled flashlight sweep.
- KF-03: black wall substance pulse and retreat.
- KF-04: corridor threshold with dense shadow and minimal door shift.

## Practical vs VFX Split
- Practical: production design details, prop logic, light fixtures, corridor surfaces.
- VFX: subtle wall pulse, microscopic material behavior, imperceptible environmental response.
- Guardrail: VFX must never override forensic realism.

## Lighting Notes
- Day interiors: practical cool utility lighting with dead zones.
- Night interiors: red-emergency accents plus narrow flashlight keys.
- Corridor: contrast-heavy but legible edge definition.

## Wrong Normal Cues
- Cleanly stacked gloves and tools left in usable order.
- Precisely labeled sample containers and marked workstation lines.
- Doors and switches in controlled standby positions, not forced open panic states.
