# Visual Concept - Ensemble (Baranov, Sato, Lund, Alvarez)

Intent: Make each ensemble member visually legible as a distinct survival logic under the same system pressure.

## Non-negotiables
- Ensemble blocking must communicate fracture over time.
- Utility props are identity signals, not decoration.
- Team shape changes after Alvarez loss must be immediately readable.

## Do / Don't
### Do
- Assign each character a stable prop vocabulary (Sato meter, Lund cockpit, Baranov tools).
- Use spacing changes as emotional telemetry.
- Preserve role hierarchy in frame geography during operational scenes.
### Don't
- Do not turn supporting team into interchangeable fear extras.
- Do not flatten line delivery into uniform panic tone.
- Do not remove operational logic from staging.

## Key Frames
- KF-01: full six-person configuration at Camp D1 entry.
- KF-02: split attention around corridor contact.
- KF-03: borehole edge debate under weather clock.
- KF-04: five-person geometry after Alvarez disappears.

## Practical vs VFX Split
- Practical: ensemble blocking, prop specificity, breath and movement rhythm.
- VFX: minimal support for deep-space continuity around team in large chambers.
- Guardrail: Team readability must survive all VFX passes.

## Lighting Notes
- Shared practical key with subtle character-specific edge response.
- More negative fill as hierarchy breaks down.
- Keep Lund tied to cockpit/console practicals when possible.

## Makeup/FX Escalation
- Baseline: cold exposure realism only.
- Mid-film: selective fatigue and dehydration increase by role load.
- Late-film: retain human recognizability; no broad creature-like contamination.

## Wardrobe Contamination Rule
- Baranov: highest mechanical grime and particulate build.
- Sato: controlled device-side wear, sleeve edge contamination.
- Lund: cleaner cockpit silhouette with weather-driven edge frost.
- Alvarez: field-facing abrasion and snow saturation pre-disappearance.

## Script Anchors
- `#5` to `#15` Camp team dynamics
- `#16` to `#21` borehole and descent threshold
- `#29` to `#31` loss, extraction, and reconfiguration
