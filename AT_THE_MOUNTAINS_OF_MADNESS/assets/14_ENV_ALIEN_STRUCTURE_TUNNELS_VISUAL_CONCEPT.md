# Environment Visual Concept - Alien Structure Tunnels

Intent: Stage the tunnels as active engineered anatomy where space itself performs analysis.

## Non-negotiables
- Tunnel geometry must read intentional and repeatable.
- Material behavior remains subtle, never fantasy-biological spectacle.
- Forward movement should feel like entering a protocol, not exploring ruins.

## Do / Don't
### Do
- Use long axial lines and depth cues to imply system continuity.
- Keep wall relief behavior low-amplitude and data-like.
- Frame team movement as tolerated presence rather than conquest.
### Don't
- Do not texture walls with random alien clutter.
- Do not animate broad pulsing/morphing events without narrative trigger.
- Do not break tunnel logic with impossible jump geography.

## Key Frames
- KF-01: first tunnel reveal from shaft floor.
- KF-02: moving beam across fibrous black surface.
- KF-03: low-frequency wall response near system event.
- KF-04: ascent tunnel compression under structural closure.

## Practical vs VFX Split
- Practical: hero wall sections, floor interaction, moisture/frost contact zones.
- VFX: deep tunnel extension, micro-relief activity, closure progression in distance.
- Guardrail: practical texture should dominate all close coverage.

## Lighting Notes
- Keep practical beam cones narrow and motivated.
- Preserve heavy negative space without losing orientation.
- Cyan accents are event-linked, not ambient decoration.
