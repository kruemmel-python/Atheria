# VFX Philosophy Policy (v7.1)

Intent: Protect the film's clinical tone by defining where VFX serves story precision and where it is explicitly constrained.

## Non-negotiables
- Practical-first execution in all actor-proximate zones.
- VFX is a scale and continuity tool, not a style replacement engine.
- Every VFX event must preserve geographic readability and tonal restraint.

## Do / Don't
### Do
- Use practical snow/wind/props and near-surface structure texture as baseline reality.
- Reserve VFX for depth, extension, subtle system behavior, and continuity stitching.
- Enforce early asset lock and shot-level intent notes before vendor turnarounds.
### Don't
- Do not deploy loud morphing events that read as fantasy creature content.
- Do not stack heavy particulate simulations that reduce shot clarity.
- Do not add bioluminescent fantasy color language inconsistent with the palette policy.

## Key Frames
- KF-01: Camp corridor contact where practical set detail carries fear.
- KF-02: Archive wall activation where VFX remains low-amplitude and data-like.
- KF-03: Final aerial mirror where VFX supports atmosphere continuity, not spectacle.

## Practical vs VFX Split
- Practical:
- Snow, wind, rotor interaction, costume contamination, hero props.
- Camp and chamber near-field textures, contact surfaces, mirror staging.
- Actor-light interaction for all close coverage.
- VFX:
- Deep shaft/tunnel/chamber extension and scale continuity.
- Subtle material micro-movement and relief activation behavior.
- Eye-event refinement and controlled atmospheric enhancement.
- Policy Guardrail:
- If the shot still communicates with VFX muted to 30%, baseline is healthy.

## Lighting Notes
- VFX comps must preserve practical lighting logic and shadow direction.
- Cyan system accents stay event-specific, never broad environmental wash.
- Black levels should hold texture detail; avoid crushed fantasy silhouettes.

## Script Anchors
- Camp contact: `#13 INT. CAMP D1 - KORRIDOR - NACHT`
- Archive contact: `#25 INT. ITERATIONSKAMMER - ARCHIVWAND`
- Elder Thing analysis: `#28 INT. ITERATIONSKAMMER - TUNNELEINGANG - FORTSETZUNG`
- Final loop: `#35 EXT. ANTARKTIS - LUFTAUFNAHME - TAG`
