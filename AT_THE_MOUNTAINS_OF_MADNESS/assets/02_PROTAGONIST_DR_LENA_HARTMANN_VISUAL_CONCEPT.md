# Visual Concept - Dr. Lena Hartmann

Intent: Frame Hartmann as the film's ethical optics system, reading risk before others verbalize it.

## Non-negotiables
- Hartmann's authority is observational precision, not volume.
- Her choices must feel active, not reactive.
- She is the first reliable witness of Keller's instability markers.

## Do / Don't
### Do
- Favor reaction framing after system anomalies.
- Keep her blocking close to evidence surfaces (sample, scope, monitor, form).
- Use eye-line continuity to signal silent understanding.
### Don't
- Do not turn her into exposition delivery machine.
- Do not over-style wardrobe beyond practical scientific function.
- Do not frame her as frightened victim in late acts.

## Key Frames
- KF-01: glance from son photo to Keller.
- KF-02: covert glove bagging after blood trace.
- KF-03: measured look during pupil anomaly.
- KF-04: corridor signature on institutional form.

## Practical vs VFX Split
- Practical: prop handling, micro-gesture timing, controlled posture.
- VFX: none required for Hartmann body track; keep as physical reference anchor.
- Guardrail: Her track should feel grounded enough to validate surrounding unreality.

## Lighting Notes
- Cooler fill values than Keller for objective contrast.
- Side-lit profile in diagnostic scenes to emphasize analytical edge.
- Flat white institutional light in final corridor for moral desaturation.

## Makeup/FX Escalation
- Level 1 (`#2` to `#7`): clean, low-fatigue baseline.
- Level 2 (`#14` to `#24`): controlled fatigue, colder skin tone, reduced facial warmth.
- Level 3 (`#33`): almost administrative neutrality; fatigue internalized.

## Wardrobe Contamination Rule
- Act I: organized scientific kit, minimal exterior frost.
- Act II: targeted contamination on cuffs/knees from sampling and contact zones.
- Act III: cleaned-up outer layer in institution to signal forced narrative control.
