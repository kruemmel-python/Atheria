# Environment Visual Concept - Isolation Station and Final Loop

Intent: End with procedural chill where institutional control and cosmic recurrence collapse into one visual statement.

## Non-negotiables
- Isolation spaces must feel administratively clean, not dramatic.
- Final loop must directly echo opening image architecture.
- End cards must read as machine-state communication, not trailer tags.

## Do / Don't
### Do
- Keep corridor composition formal and bureaucratic.
- Use mirror framing as identity fracture device, not jump-scare setup.
- Let final aerial mirror hold long enough for meaning shift.
### Don't
- Do not warm up color or texture for emotional comfort.
- Do not overscore the final sequence.
- Do not add explanatory visuals that close the ambiguity.

## Key Frames
- KF-01: Hartmann signing institutional statement.
- KF-02: Keller isolated in white room with recorder.
- KF-03: mirror approach and pupil event.
- KF-04: status-card stack progression.
- KF-05: closing aerial loop with repeated signal structure.

## Practical vs VFX Split
- Practical: institutional corridor/room builds, mirror staging, recorder props.
- VFX: subtle eye event refinement, final aerial atmosphere continuity.
- Guardrail: ending should feel physically real enough to remain unsettling.

## Lighting Notes
- Corridor: broad flat white with minimal shadow personality.
- Room: similarly flat, with slight eye catchlight control for mirror beat.
- Closing aerial: match opening luminance profile for hard mirror fidelity.

## Institutional Sound Blank
- Acoustic bed in isolation scenes should be near-dead.
- Primary audible elements: breath, cloth movement, recorder mechanics.
- Introduce final signal/hum cue as a precise closing sting, not a rising horror swell.

## Script Anchors
- `#33 INT. ISOLATIONSSTATION - KORRIDOR - TAGE SPAETER`
- `#34 INT. ISOLATIONSRAUM - TAGE SPAETER`
- `#35 EXT. ANTARKTIS - LUFTAUFNAHME - TAG`
- End cards: `STATUS: BEWERTUNG ABGESCHLOSSEN`, `STATUS: INTEGRATION AKTIV`, `STATUS: ITERATION AKTIV`
