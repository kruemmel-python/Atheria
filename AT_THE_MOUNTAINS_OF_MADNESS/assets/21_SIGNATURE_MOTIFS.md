# Signature Motifs - Repeating Image Tokens

Intent: Lock motif continuity across editorial, color, production design, and sound as one integrated language.

## Non-negotiables
- Motifs must evolve meaning, not just recur visually.
- Each motif needs a clear first use, transformation point, and final use.
- Motifs should remain sparse enough to retain signal strength.

## Do / Don't
### Do
- Track motif state in script supervision and post timelines.
- Tie motif recurrence to story turns, not random callbacks.
- Coordinate motif color/sound signatures across departments.
### Don't
- Do not over-repeat motifs in neutral scenes.
- Do not introduce untracked visual symbols late in post.
- Do not detach motif transformations from character arc shifts.

## Motif Matrix
| Motif | First Use | Transformation | Final Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Son photo | Helicopter intro (`#2`) | From memory object to proof-obsession trigger | Son-like chamber iteration (`#23`/`#24`) |
| Notebook / protocol writing | Early control behavior (`#2`) | Control turns into compulsive evidence logic | Institutional-end ambiguity frame (`#34`) |
| Cyan measurement accent | Camp diagnostics (`#7`, `#14`) | Device readout to system-response marker | Integration process coding in end status logic |
| Mirror image | Isolation room setup (`#34`) | Identity confidence rupture via pupil event | Replacement question unresolved in final beat |
| Status cards | Institutional process layer (`#34`) | Human report frame collapses into machine process frame | `STATUS: ITERATION AKTIV` (`#35` ending) |
| Distorted signal + deep hum | Opening unknown cue (`#1`/`#2`) | Reframed as active system communication | Closing mirror confirms cycle recurrence |

## Practical vs VFX Split
- Practical: photo, notebook, recorder, mirrors, status typography integration.
- VFX: subtle eye-event assist, signal display enhancement, atmospheric motif continuity.
- Guardrail: motif clarity should survive with minimal VFX.

## Lighting Notes
- Keep motifs legible through controlled contrast, not hard spotlighting.
- Cyan motif should never become ambient sci-fi wash.
- Mirror motif requires precise eye catchlight management.

## Script Anchors
- `#2 INT. HELIKOPTER - TAG`
- `#23` to `#26` Iteration and archive axis
- `#34 INT. ISOLATIONSRAUM - TAGE SPAETER`
- `#35 EXT. ANTARKTIS - LUFTAUFNAHME - TAG`
