# Environment Visual Concept - Antarctic Surface

Intent: Use the surface world as scale-negation space where humans read as fragile temporary entries.

## Non-negotiables
- Surface frames must communicate orientation loss before threat.
- Helicopter scale must stay modest, never heroic.
- Opening/closing aerial language must match structurally.

## Do / Don't
### Do
- Keep broad white fields with minimal landmarks.
- Use wind direction as compositional force line.
- Preserve signal distortion + deep hum relationship at opening and closing.
### Don't
- Do not beautify into postcard landscape imagery.
- Do not overpopulate sky with effects noise.
- Do not restore comfort through warm color drift.

## Key Frames
- KF-01: opening aerial void with tiny black helicopter.
- KF-02: Camp D1 landing in blown snow haze.
- KF-03: borehole perimeter in low-contrast morning grey.
- KF-04: closing aerial mirror with cycle implication.

## Practical vs VFX Split
- Practical: wind rigs, snow texture foreground, rotor-driven interaction.
- VFX: horizon extension, atmospheric depth continuity, controlled whiteout shaping.
- Guardrail: Keep white field believable and physically coherent.

## Lighting Notes
- Overcast diffuse key, low shadow separation.
- Avoid rich blue skies; preserve muted polar tonality.
- Use subtle contrast gains only at narrative pressure points.

## Horizon Discipline
- Act I opening: horizon intentionally unstable or absent.
- Mid exterior operational beats: limited horizon return for tactical orientation.
- Closing mirror: horizon ambiguity returns to complete cycle logic.
