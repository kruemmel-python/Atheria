# Environment Visual Concept - Borehole and Vertical Shaft

Intent: Make the descent space the physical lock of the narrative where return becomes impossible.

## Non-negotiables
- Verticality must be felt before the collapse happens.
- Point-of-no-return moment must be geographically unambiguous.
- Depth should read as engineered void, not cave randomness.

## Do / Don't
### Do
- Track ropes, cable lengths, and edge markers for spatial continuity.
- Use controlled vibration cues to pre-signal failure.
- Stage collapse with cause-and-effect readability.
### Don't
- Do not hide key collapse mechanics inside FX fog.
- Do not cut so fast that loss of return path is unclear.
- Do not stylize shaft walls into fantasy cave textures.

## Key Frames
- KF-01: borehole edge in morning grey with team ring.
- KF-02: cable depth feed with no floor return.
- KF-03: top-down shaft void with diminishing light.
- KF-04: edge collapse and sealed entry confirmation.

## Practical vs VFX Split
- Practical: edge build, rope rig, ice debris, actor interaction with descent hardware.
- VFX: shaft depth extension, distant dust/frost behavior, collapse continuity.
- Guardrail: physical collapse beats must remain stunt-led, not simulated-only.

## Lighting Notes
- Surface: overcast diffused light with low-contrast skin rendering.
- Shaft: fast falloff to darkness with practical lamps as depth markers.
- Collapse: brief high-contrast flashes from falling reflective ice planes.
