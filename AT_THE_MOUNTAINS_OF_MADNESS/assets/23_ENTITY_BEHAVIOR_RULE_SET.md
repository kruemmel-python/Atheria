# Entity Behavior Rule Set (Elder Thing + Shoggoth) — v7.1 Studio Polish

Intent: Define strict behavior grammar so entities remain procedural intelligences, not monster antagonists.

## Non-negotiables
- Entities are evaluators/operators, never rage-driven hunters.
- Movement reads measured and purposeful at all times.
- Interaction priority is sensing/comparing/classifying, not killing.
- No animal-coded performance language (roars, panting, pounce grammar).

## Entity Operating Modes
### Elder Thing (Analyzer / Protocol Executor)
- Treats humans as data objects under inspection.
- Approaches only when measurement is required; withdraws once classification completes.
- Presence communicates *intent*, not threat display.

### Shoggoth (Instrument / Adaptive Tool)
- Behaves like a deployed system tool, not a free-willed predator.
- Motion is task-linked (contain, cut off routes, retrieve, stabilize), never “chase for sport”.
- Reacts to system states, not to human emotion.

## Engagement Zones (Blocking Logic)
- Zone 1 — Observe (>6m): silhouette + hum presence, no rush, no escalation.
- Zone 2 — Measure (2–6m): slow calibrated approach, one or two purposeful stops.
- Zone 3 — Contact (<2m): sensor/forehead contact → immediate processing stillness → disengage.

## Do / Don't
### Do
- Stage entity beats as controlled interventions with clear operational intent.
- Keep distance logic consistent (observe -> approach -> measure -> disengage).
- Use silence and low-frequency system tones as primary presence cues.
### Don't
- Do not use jump-lunge choreography or slasher pursuit grammar.
- Do not add roar-heavy creature audio language or “predator breathing”.
- Do not over-animate morphology into fantasy spectacle.

## Tempo Law
- No sprint speeds. Maximum velocity reads as “operational glide”.
- Acceleration is allowed only as repositioning, never as an attack beat.

## Key Frames
- KF-01: Corridor probe stops within breath-distance of Keller’s forehead (measurement, not strike).
- KF-02: Chamber threshold hold: entity remains at boundary, calibrates, then enters.
- KF-03: Elder Thing slow orbit around Keller as object-analysis pattern.
- KF-04: Sensor-to-forehead contact and immediate data-processing stillness.
- KF-05: Post-analysis withdrawal without attack escalation.

## Practical vs VFX Split
- Practical: on-set distance marks, actor eyelines, tempo of approach/retreat, interaction staging.
- VFX: subtle surface reorganization, micro-sensor extension, scale reinforcement, continuity cleanup.
- Guardrail: If behavior reads "creature aggression" with VFX muted, staging must be revised.

## Sound Policy (3 layers)
- Layer 1: infrasonic hum = system-state presence.
- Layer 2: dry micro-clicks = sensor reconfiguration.
- Layer 3: silence drop = decision / processing.
- Guardrail: If sound implies “animal threat”, remove and re-ground.

## Lighting Notes
- Avoid horror-underlight tropes that imply jump-scare intent.
- Keep edge highlights controlled to preserve geometry and orientation.
- Entity readability should come from silhouette logic, not bright effect accents.

## Violation Test
- If a viewer would describe the beat as "the monster attacks", the grammar is wrong.
