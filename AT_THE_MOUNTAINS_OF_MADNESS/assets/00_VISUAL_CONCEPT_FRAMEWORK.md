# Visual Concept Framework (v7.1 Studio Polish)

Intent: Build a controlled, premium cosmic-horror language where revelation is the primary threat vector.

## Non-negotiables
- Horror is epistemic first (what is learned), not attack-driven first (what lunges).
- Visual precision always wins over "cool chaos" or arbitrary spectacle.
- Opening and closing image grammar must mirror each other with a meaning shift.

## Do / Don't
### Do
- Frame humans as small process variables inside large intentional systems.
- Keep geometry readable even in fear-heavy scenes.
- Use silence and low-frequency hum as system-state indicators.
### Don't
- Do not stage the entities like rage creatures or slasher antagonists.
- Do not flood frames with decorative particles that reduce legibility.
- Do not switch to handheld panic coverage that exceeds character panic.

## Key Frames
- KF-01: White void aerial, tiny helicopter, distorted signal, no stable orientation.
- KF-02: Corridor contact at Camp D1, wrong-normal order, measured proximity.
- KF-03: Iteration chamber reveal, rows first, people second, meaning last.
- KF-04: Isolationsraum mirror close, pupil shift, procedural dread.
- KF-05: Closing aerial mirror with `STATUS: ITERATION AKTIV`.

## Practical vs VFX Split
- Practical: Snow, wind, camp props, corridor texture, actor-light interaction, near-surface set detail.
- VFX: Depth extension, subtle living-material micro-motion, archive relief activity, scale continuity.
- Guardrail: If an effect reads as fantasy creature FX, reduce and re-ground.

## Lighting Notes
- Exterior: low-contrast cold whites with directional wind streak highlights.
- Camp: practical motivated pools, darker corners that keep geometry intact.
- Chamber: narrow motivated beams, low ambient floor, controlled cyan accents.

## Script Anchors
