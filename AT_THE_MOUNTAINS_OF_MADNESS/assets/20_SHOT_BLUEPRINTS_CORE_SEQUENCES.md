# Shot Blueprints - Core Sequences (Previs Feed)

Intent: Provide department-ready shot-run skeletons for the three most critical sequence engines.

## Non-negotiables
- Shot order must preserve story logic before style flourish.
- Spatial continuity must remain readable in all three sequences.
- Sound cues are part of shot design, not post-only decoration.

## Do / Don't
### Do
- Keep each beat tied to narrative information gain.
- Maintain objective-to-subjective shift only at defined beats.
- Use scale cues repeatedly.
### Don't
- Do not cut for speed at the expense of orientation.
- Do not front-load all effects in the first three shots.
- Do not detach sound transitions from visual beats.

## Sequence A - Opening Aerial / Distorted Signal
- SHOT 01: EXT WIDE aerial / static hold / white void scale cue.
- SHOT 02: EXT WIDE aerial / slow drift / helicopter enters frame as black point.
- SHOT 03: EXT MED long lens / rotor against wind streak / fragility cue.
- SHOT 04: INT cockpit insert / analog signal unit / static begins.
- SHOT 05: INT close on Keller profile / no dialogue / listening state.
- SHOT 06: INT radio speaker macro / distortion texture increases.
- SHOT 07: EXT aerial oblique / horizon instability / orientation loss.
- SHOT 08: INT instrument insert / distorted voice fragment "...Camp D1...".
- SHOT 09: INT reaction split / team silent lock / deep hum enters under noise.
- SHOT 10: EXT transition wide / helicopter continues forward / cut to Camp D1 approach.

## Sequence B - Vertical Shaft Collapse (Point of No Return)
- SHOT 01: EXT top-down wide / full team at borehole edge / rope and marker visibility.
- SHOT 02: INSERT cable monitor / depth feed unstable / no floor return.
- SHOT 03: POV down shaft / beam swallowed by darkness.
- SHOT 04: MED on descent team / rope tension increases.
- SHOT 05: INSERT anchor hardware / micro-vibration and ice crack.
- SHOT 06: CLOSE Baranov/Sato / recognition beat before failure.
- SHOT 07: EXT edge profile / structural shear and ice plate break.
- SHOT 08: WIDE collapse read / entry geometry changes clearly.
- SHOT 09: CLOSE on blocked rim / debris lock / "return path gone" clarity.
- SHOT 10: MED Keller command beat / forward-only decision.

## Sequence C - Iteration Chamber Reveal (Staged Ladder)
- SHOT 01: TUNNEL EXIT wide / chamber darkness with row hints only.
- SHOT 02: MED move-in / beam cuts first line geometry (pattern before identity).
- SHOT 03: INSERT silhouette in frost / first human form recognition.
- SHOT 04: REACTION close Keller/Hartmann / cognitive hesitation.
- SHOT 05: lateral pass / near-human variation appears in same row logic.
- SHOT 06: WIDE depth read / serial structure extends beyond visibility.
- SHOT 07: CLOSE on son-like profile in chamber / denial beat.
- SHOT 08: TRACK to archive wall / surface relief starts micro-response.
- SHOT 09: HAND CONTACT insert / wall activation and hum shift.
- SHOT 10: SUBJECTIVE rupture montage / data not image.
- SHOT 11: RETURN WIDE / team scale collapses against chamber scale.
- SHOT 12: ENTITY threshold frame / measured presence, not attack posture.

## Practical vs VFX Split
- Practical: camera blocking, actor responses, hero props, key contact surfaces.
- VFX: depth extension, subtle material response, continuity of large-scale architecture.
- Guardrail: no shot should require FX to explain geography.

## Lighting Notes
- Opening: diffuse white low-contrast with directional wind cues.
- Shaft: aggressive falloff and practical lamp depth markers.
- Chamber: low ambient, staged beam reveals, controlled cyan event accents.

## Script Anchors
- Opening sequence: `#1` and `#2`
- Shaft collapse: `#19`, `#20`, `#21`
- Chamber reveal ladder: `#23`, `#24`, `#25`, `#26`
