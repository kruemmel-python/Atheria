Source images: `Hollywood-Pitch-Deck\final\images`

## Slide 01 - AT THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS

- Chapter: Cover
- Image: `images/Antarctic Surface.png`
- The oldest intelligence on Earth is not hunting us. It is evaluating us.

## Slide 02 - Pitch Focus

- Chapter: Story Engine
- Image: `images/Core Sequences.png`
- This image-driven pitch presents character arcs, environment grammar, and production guardrails.
- Goal: a studio-readable package where tone, behavior, and visual escalation stay controlled.

## Slide 03 - Dr. Elias Keller

- Chapter: Protagonists
- Image: `images/Keller.png`
- Present Keller as a control-driven scientist whose grief slowly breaks visual certainty.
- Keller never plays as an action hero silhouette.
- Inner conflict must be readable in micro-behavior before dialogue states it.

## Slide 04 - Dr. Lena Hartmann

- Chapter: Protagonists
- Image: `images/Hartmann.png`
- Frame Hartmann as the film's ethical optics system, reading risk before others verbalize it.
- Hartmann's authority is observational precision, not volume.
- Her choices must feel active, not reactive.

## Slide 05 - Ensemble Dynamics

- Chapter: Protagonists
- Image: `images/Ensemble.png`
- Make each ensemble member visually legible as a distinct survival logic under the same system pressure.
- Ensemble blocking must communicate fracture over time.
- Utility props are identity signals, not decoration.

## Slide 06 - Antarctic Surface

- Chapter: Environments
- Image: `images/Antarctic Surface.png`
- Use the surface world as scale-negation space where humans read as fragile temporary entries.
- Surface frames must communicate orientation loss before threat.
- Helicopter scale must stay modest, never heroic.

## Slide 07 - Camp D1: Wrong Normal

- Chapter: Environments
- Image: `images/Camp.png`
- Present Camp D1 as "wrong normal" architecture where procedural order replaces human panic.
- Camp should feel active-adjacent, not abandoned-ruin.
- Every room must imply previous methodical action.

## Slide 08 - Borehole + Vertical Shaft

- Chapter: Environments
- Image: `images/Borehole and Vertical Shaft.png`
- Make the descent space the physical lock of the narrative where return becomes impossible.
- Verticality must be felt before the collapse happens.
- Point-of-no-return moment must be geographically unambiguous.

## Slide 09 - Alien Structure Tunnels (Entry)

- Chapter: Environments
- Image: `images/Alien Structure Tunnels 1.png`
- Stage the tunnels as active engineered anatomy where space itself performs analysis.
- Tunnel geometry must read intentional and repeatable.
- Material behavior remains subtle, never fantasy-biological spectacle.

## Slide 10 - Alien Structure Tunnels (Pressure)

- Chapter: Environments
- Image: `images/Alien Structure Tunnels 2.png`
- Stage the tunnels as active engineered anatomy where space itself performs analysis.
- Tunnel geometry must read intentional and repeatable.
- Material behavior remains subtle, never fantasy-biological spectacle.

## Slide 11 - Iteration Chamber + Archive

- Chapter: Environments
- Image: `images/Iteration Chamber and Archive Wall.png`
- Deliver the film's central ontological shock through controlled visual escalation, not spectacle overload.
- Chamber reveal must be staged in steps, never as one total dump.
- Bodies read as archived series, not gore tableau.

## Slide 12 - Isolation + Final Loop

- Chapter: Environments
- Image: `images/Isolation Station and Final Loop.png`
- End with procedural chill where institutional control and cosmic recurrence collapse into one visual statement.
- Isolation spaces must feel administratively clean, not dramatic.
- Final loop must directly echo opening image architecture.

## Slide 13 - Core Sequences Blueprint

- Chapter: Execution
- Image: `images/Core Sequences.png`
- Provide department-ready shot-run skeletons for the three most critical sequence engines.
- Shot order must preserve story logic before style flourish.
- Spatial continuity must remain readable in all three sequences.

## Slide 14 - Signature Motifs

- Chapter: Execution
- Image: `images/Repeating Image Tokens.png`
- Lock motif continuity across editorial, color, production design, and sound as one integrated language.
- Motifs must evolve meaning, not just recur visually.
- Each motif needs a clear first use, transformation point, and final use.

## Slide 15 - VFX Philosophy

- Chapter: Execution
- Image: `images/VFX Philosophy Policy.png`
- Protect the film's clinical tone by defining where VFX serves story precision and where it is explicitly constrained.
- Practical-first execution in all actor-proximate zones.
- VFX is a scale and continuity tool, not a style replacement engine.

## Slide 16 - Entity Behavior Rules

- Chapter: Execution
- Image: `images/Entity Behavior Rule Set.png`
- Define strict behavior grammar so entities remain procedural intelligences, not monster antagonists.
- Entities are evaluators/operators, never rage-driven hunters.
- Movement reads measured and purposeful at all times.

## Slide 17 - Final Production Read

- Chapter: Close
- Image: `images/Antarctic Surface.png`
- Department-ready visual control system from prep to final mix.
- If a choice increases spectacle but reduces meaning clarity, reject it.
